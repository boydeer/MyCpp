/*
EEEN20011 - Lecture 10 Example Program 1

This program uses the Nucleo-64 board and the Application Shield.

The program toggles the red led every 5 seconds
After 5 second has elapsed, it checks if the centre pin of the joystick is pressed
When the program detects that the button has been pressed the green LED is toggled

The program will only respond to the push button if the button press is detected
at the end of the wait period. If the button is pressed during the 'wait(5.00)'
statement, then the green LED will not toggle

It would be possible to poll the button more frequently, but this would make
it harder to maintain the 5 second toggling of the red LED.
It would also be wasteful of resources to check repeatedly.
