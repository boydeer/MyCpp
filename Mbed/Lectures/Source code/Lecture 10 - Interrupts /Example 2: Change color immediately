/*
EEEN20011 - Lecture 10 Example Program 2

This program uses the Nucleo-64 board and the Application Shield.

The program toggles the red led every 5 seconds

A 'rising-edge' interrupt is attached to the centre pin of the joystick.
When button press is detected the interrupt service routine pressedISR()
is executed. This toggled the green LED.

The interrupt can be generated at any point in the execution of the program,
including during the 5 second delay.
