/*
EEEN20011 - Lecture 7 Example Program 2 - Static Variables

This program is not designed to run on the Nucleo board. It will run on a PC-based C++ compiler.
You may wish to modify this program to run on the Nucleo, using the LCD to output the printf statements.

The code illustrates the operation of a static variable. The variable is initialised on the first occasion when myFunction() is executed, however remembers its previous value for subsequent function calls.
Removing the 'static' modifier would result in the variable being declared each time myFunction was executed, and "Counter value is: 0" would be printed for each function call.

#include<iostream>

void myFunction(void) {								//Declared function myFunction()
	static int counter = 0;							//Declaration of static variable
	printf("Counter value is: %u \n", counter);		//Prints the value of counter
	counter++;										//Increments counter
}

int main() {										//Main function

	myFunction();									//Calls myFunction three times
	myFunction();
	myFunction();
}
